**Heart Disease Prediction Project**
**Task Objective**
The objective of this project is to build and evaluate machine learning model that can predict the presence of heart disease in patients based on clinical and demographic features. Early detection of heart disease can help in timely intervention and better management of cardiovascular risk.

**Dataset Used**
Source: Kaggle - Heart Failure Prediction Dataset
**Description:**
The dataset contains 11 features related to patient health, such as age, sex, chest pain type, blood pressure, cholesterol, fasting blood sugar, ECG results, maximum heart rate, exercise-induced angina, oldpeak, and ST segment slope.
**Target Variable:**
HeartDisease (1 = presence of heart disease, 0 = absence)
**Model Applied**
Decision Tree Classifier
Model is trained and evaluated using an 80/20 train-test split. Categorical variables were one-hot encoded before model training.

**Key Results and Findings**
**Best Model Performance:**

The Decision Tree model achieved an ROC-AUC score of 0.91 on the validation set, indicating excellent discrimination between patients with and without heart disease.
The confusion matrix showed high accuracy, with both false positives and false negatives being low.
**Feature Importance:**

The most important features for prediction were:
ST_Slope_Up
ChestPainType_ASY
Oldpeak
MaxHR
These features contributed most to the modelâ€™s decision-making process.
**Conclusion:**

The trained model can effectively predict heart disease risk using the provided features.
The project demonstrates the value of machine learning in medical risk prediction and highlights the importance of certain clinical features in heart disease diagnosis.
